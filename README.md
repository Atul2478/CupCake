### This project is a school project and is used to develop our own skills, feel free to use as you wish, it's great for reference if you're making the Cupcake project yourself. Although it should have been more persistent in the use of logic, I tend to play around with the many 'ways' of 'doing' 'things'. As such there is a lot of knowledge to comprehend by learning the ways of my project. ###
